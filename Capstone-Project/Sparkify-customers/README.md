## Project Motivation

This is Udacity Data Science Nanodegree's Capstone project. In this project we need to analyze user behavior data from music app Sparkify. The data contains the log data alongwith some basic information about the user and actions taken by them. A user has multiple logs. In this project we will churn a part of the user, through the cancellation of the account behavior or downgrade submission.

## Result

Random Forest performs the best on the dataset provided which provides a F1 score of 66.3%.
